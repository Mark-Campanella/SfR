We were very impressed to the whole line of appliances available from Jennair. We went with the 30"" built in convection microwave speed oven, The 30"" single wall oven and the Euro-style 36"" 6-burner gas cooktop. We have been using these appliances every day now for better than 6-months and couldn't be any happier with our selection. The burner controls are easy to set for just the right amount of heat to cook what you are making. The power burners make short work of getting a big pot of water ready to take on a box of pasta. They are helpful as well when you want just a little more heat to cook something fast. Simmering a pot of soup on the small burner is a great help when orchestrating a meal using the 5 other burners to cook up a masterpiece. We'd recommend the Jennair Euro-Style 36"" 6-Burner Gas Cooktop, as well as the whole line of Jennair appliances, to anyone getting serious about upgrading their kitchen appliances. Jennair is definitely a top-of-the-line choice.",

The design and appearance are a huge improvement over my old cooktop. It is very easy to clean because all the surfaces are stainless steel and easily reachable. You just need to use a non-abrasive cleaner. The grids appear to be cast iron, also easy to remove and clean, though a bit heavy. The burners are very effective and the four burners each have a different BTU rating, so you can go from quick-boil down to a bare simmer. The smallest burner also has a special cap for the gentlest heating, like melting chocolate. The exhaust fan with three speeds is an upgrade over my old one with one speed. The only question is what will happen if I get a big spillover. I'm concerned that liquid may get into places I can't access for cleaning, but so far so good.",

The various sizes of the four burners allow for cooking with different heat intensity from frying to just simple boiling. It does its intended job well. We believe this is a 4-star instead of 5-star appliance for two reasons. First, the grills over all four burners have the identical design and structure (shape, size, gaps in the grill). This is a problem for the smaller burners where when using a very small pot, it has to be positioned just right and slightly off-center to balance it, otherwise it tilts to one side thus potentially spilling its contents. Second, there is a schematic next to each knob indicating which burner each knob controls. This schematics are drawn very faintly and they have already started wearing off thus having to remember which knob does what. Other than these two items, it's a fine cooktop.",

First one, the wifi didn't work; second one, back burners only lit after about 20 clicks or so. By then, so much gas built up that it would light with a big flash of gas. This third one (installed last month) is having wifi connection issues; still troubleshooting with JennAir tech. The main issue I have is how easy the front stainless steel panel scratches. If you place anything on the polished top, it will scratch it. Seems the top sides and back are finished in a way where they don't scratch as easily. Also, the knobs get permanent stains if you don't clean them quickly. Cleaning is a bit difficult with all the crevices and non-removable parts to get to those areas. Otherwise, it's a great, professional looking, and good cooking range. The burners can be set at infinite flame levels and burn evenly. Oven cooks great and even also.",

We moved to an older house with an old coil electric cook top so it was time for an upgrade. Of course I went straight to whirlpool. After reading the reviews I became concerned. How can that many people have trouble cleaning a glass top stove. I headed to the store to take a look. Some brilliant person decided to give the glass an ever so slight textured finish! What a shame. At that point I was on a mission for a different cook top and struggled to find what I wanted. I came upon this JennAire and it is just fabulous! It has features I didn't even realize when bought it. I wanted large burners when I do my canning a large crowd. Just has a 12-inch triple burner, and a 10 inch double burner along with two smaller burners. The knobs are gorgeous, it sounds funny to say but they are metal and sleek. Not only does it have a hot surface button that lights up, but also has a power on button so you can tell if the stove top is turned off or not. Also each knob when turned on lights up at the base so you can actually see which knob is on. I look forward to many years use with this quality cook top.",

Any little grease splatter leaves smears and streaks. I was able to wipe my old cooktop off with warm soapy water and wipe it off and it looked beautiful. Now I have to clean with Affresh, a scrubber, and wipe repeatedly with a microfiber cloth to remove smudges. I am hoping it improves with repeated use of Affresh cleaner.",

My new version has 2 features that are not as good as my old one. First, the old one had digital, pointer-finger controls which were much better than the new knobs for several reasons. First, when your fingers are slippery from cooking activities, it is almost impossible to turn the knobs...but it was easy to point just one finger on the touch-screen of the old cook top. Second, it is way harder to keep the stove clean with the knobs gathering grease easily. Also, the glass top of my former cooktop was a breeze to clean with Fantastic and ceramic stove cleaner, and an occasional use of the scraper. It was CERAN brand of glass top. That's what I loved about my old cook top. I always looked new. This glass top does not get clean no matter how much effort I put in. It does not say CERAN brand...I do not know what the company used this time. Although the new one ads a little metalIic bling with its shiny metal trim all around, the trim-less older model was way easier to clean. I bought this cooktop assuming it would be as good as the one made in 2006. It isn't.",

I have used both ovens for baking, and after calibration of the temperature I am quite pleased with them. There is a built-in tool selection for calibration so that was very quick and easy to do. All functions are intuitive. The ovens are loaded with special features, many of which I will never use. My husband and I are both apprehensive about the reliability of the elecronic controls--how long will they last? Because the control panel is electronic, I probably will never use the self-cleaning mode. Everything I have read warns against using this feature with any brand of oven that has electronic controls because the heat is so high that there is a great risk of ""frying"" the board, which is exactly what happened with my previous ovens of another excellent brand. Also, ALL manufacturers should take note that there are millions of homes that were constructed in the last 30 years that accommodate only 24 to 27"" wide ovens. No one wants to remodel their kitchen just to replace ovens. My cabinet space had to be trimmed and partially reconstructed to accommodate the new 27"" oven--same size as my old ones. This makes me wonder why on earth there are so many 30"" models available and so few of the smaller sizes. Someone is missing a bet. Each of my 27"" ovens can accommodate 4 loaves of bread. Most younger people buying new homes don't even bake, so why the need for huge 30"" wide ovens? One feature that I very much appreciate is that the heat does not blow out into my face but rather is exhausted by way of a vent at the bottom, just like my old beloved ovens. Also, they are very well insulated so I can bake in the summer as well as in cooler weather. These were two huge considerations in choosing JennAir rather than other brands. The third major consideration was that no wi-fi connection was required to access any of the features.",

The oven took over 2 hours to preheat. I am now waiting for a new regulator for a brand new oven I have owned for one week. While waiting for the oven to be made usable, I tried to make pancakes for my grandchildren using the griddle. I used oil on the griddle as I was told by the salesperson to never use a cooking spray such as Pam. I preheated the griddle, coated the surface with avocado oil, added the batter. It was impossible to flip the pancakes - they were completely stuck. It took quite awhile to clean and I was terrified I would scratch the surface. Fortunately, it did not. I was skeptical about a stainless steel griddle having always had cast steel which cures very nicely. The manual is virtually useless. The only instructions for the griddle are for how to turn it on and a temperature guide - nothing on how to actually use it. The oven is too small to place a 1/2 sheet pan lengthwise front to back, so two cannot be used simultaneously on the same shelf. I will say that the burners are very nice though I'm not crazy about the grills. They look great but make pan placement difficult. All in all, I wish I'd made a different choice.",

Been using g for 6 months. Absolutely love how quiet the unit is at all speeds (boost is loud but rarely used). Best part is the ambient lighting on top of the unit. It illuminates the entire kitchen with bounced or indirect light. It would be great to have a dimmer function on both the ambient light and stove top light. Additionally, if the function buttons were backlit they would be easier to see against the black trim. Installation could be easier. Even though this works for an 8' ceiling, the two shroud covers don't allow it to be raised high enough above the cook top and setting it farther back looks strange because it is not centered. Problem for me at 6'2"" I tend to hit my head. Lower shroud needs to be at least 5"" shorter and the subframe should be more adjustable to accommodate that height. I had to cut the sub frame shorter as well as the bottom hidden portion of the top shroud.",

The sleek look is fantastic. The price was extremely high for the functionality. The bridge function seems fabulous however it very sensitive and sadly only works in the center of the panel versus the entire panel making a griddle application impossible. Disappointing!! Also very sensitive to the pan even if the pan says it is induction compatible. Also temperature controls seem to be very touchy and will turn off you have to pay attention that you're stove is still operating while something is cooking. Finally, I was additionally disappointed that heat permeates on the undersurface of the device and I am concerned that it's going to ruin my spice drawer. Overall- I could've saved an off a lot of money just replacing the old electric cooktop with a new electric cooktop",

This one is an improvement over the old one we installed in 2020 in a few ways. It has an outer edge that is stainless steel. It has metal knobs - and all knobs are out of the way on the right side. The downdraft is not as strong as our prior one, but is easier to clean. Our original Jenn-Air had plastic knobs that were inconveniently located for pans touching them and melting the edges. I love the new appearance and the function. Our one issue was that the house was wired for the old one, and the new one requires more amps, so we will always have to be aware not to turn on all 4 burners at the same time, as there is no way to change the wiring to meet the requirements of the new one.",

I would give it a five star rating but keep in the glass top clean of burned on foods and spills is a bit of a chore. The recommended cleaners don't seem up to the task as well as I expected.

On the plus side, like most induction tops it heats very quickly and is extremely responsive to temperature adjustments. It is also amazingly easy to keep clean compared to my old gas unit. The controls can be difficult to use. One would think that just sliding your finger back and forth to set the temperature would be simple, but in practice it is often difficult to get it to land on the proper number setting. For the price, it could also use more then ten temperature settings. Some times the difference between 2 and 3 is too much especially when trying to simmer a pot of rice without having it boil over. It can also be very quirky with various alarms going off for no explainable reason. It does not like it when a pot or even your hand touches the metal trim around the perimeter of the cooktop. The most annoying feature is how quickly the unit powers off after turning off the burner. You can't just turn the burner back on, you have to power the unit back on first. I give it four stars because it has been trouble free in heavy use but it is very quirky and I think JennAir could do way better given what this unit costs.",

It has a beautiful black glass finish. The silver trim and knobs gives it a classy look. My only complaint is the knob placement. I would have preferred that the top and bottom knobs coincide with the burners on the right side and the 2 middle knobs coincide with the burners on the left. Also my previous JennAire cooktop came with a razor blade to use for cleaning it. Thank you.,
