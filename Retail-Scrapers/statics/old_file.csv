LG,dle8400we,"The 2-way LG EasyLoad door opens hamper style for loading and swings open for unloading for maximum versatility. Quickly move clothes from washer to dryer and dryer to basket—and cross laundry off your list. Easy-to-use electronic controls with LED display and built-in intelligence with AI Sensor Dry take out the guesswork. Activate Smart Pairing in the LG ThinQ app and your LG washer will automatically tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle.¹ 
7.3 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.3 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
EasyLoad Door: The dual-opening options of the LG EasyLoad door make loading and unloading the dryer easier than ever. Transferring wet clothes from the washer? Simply press the release button and pull the door down, hamper style to keep that stray sock from hitting the floor. Removing dry items? Swing the door to the side to clear the way for your basket below. Even tight spaces and challenging laundry-room layouts are no match for versatility like this., 
Built-In Intelligence: AI Sensor Dry with Smart Pairing: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. AI Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes—no more damp clothes, no more overdrying., 
: With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle¹, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
ThinQ Smart Technology: The ThinQ app offers control and convenience to help you simplify life and enjoy the comforts of home. Control your dryer remotely or use voice commands with Google or Alexa voice assistants. Plus, download additional cycles and access Smart Diagnosis, customer support, and more., 
ThinQ UP: ThinQ UP enabled smart appliances receive continual software updates for new downloadable features and enhancements sent wirelessly to the appliance. Choose which features you want and customize your appliance based on your lifestyle and personal preferences., 
ThinQ Care: Available within the ThinQ app, ThinQ Care sends proactive usage, maintenance, and diagnostic alerts to your smartphone to help keep your LG smart appliances running smoothly., 
Electronic Controls with LED Display: LG’s built-in intelligence and electronic controls with LED display make it easy to get laundry day dialed in. Not only can you easily access all the cycles with a turn of the dial, but you can also quickly modify any cycle using the touch panel for total laundry control., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators let you know when your ducts and filter need cleaning to avoid lint buildup, improve the dryer’s performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and help give you safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20%² less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
: Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer. It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., 
: ¹Both washer and dryer need to be registered in LG ThinQ app and connected to wi-fi to set up Smart Pairing feature.,

LG,dlex4200w,"No longer just a companion to your washer, the LG DLEX4200W electric front load dryer delivers a new level of convenience and clothing care. TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles in just 10 minutes for those times when there is no time to wash. Built-in intelligence automatically selects the right settings to eliminate the guesswork, and can even talk to your washer to pick a compatible cycle. Smart features fit your life with the ability to start the dryer when you are on the go or send routine maintenance updates to help you protect your investment. All of this convenience with a sleed design and scratch-resistant tempered glass door with chrome accents. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
TurboSteam Technology: Go ahead, wear it again—in just 10 minutes, TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles and odors in up to 5 garments when you don’t have time to wash. Also refreshes children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best.,

Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers are the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents*., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when ducts and filter need cleaning of lint buildup, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., ",39,27,30.12,7.4,$674.99,4.6,577,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-7-4-cu-ft-stackable-smart-electric-dryer-with-steam-and-built-in-intelligence-white/6419626.p?skuId=6419626,7.4 Cu.

LG,dlhc5502w,"Compared to conventional vented dryers, this LG HeatPump dryer uses up to 65% less energy to dry every load.¹ How? By smartly recycling the pre-warmed air rather than venting it outside. But savings are only one reason to start drying differently. Ventless design can be installed almost anywhere, with a modern look that elevates any room. Even caring for favorite clothes takes a new turn—our exclusive Direct Drive Motor delivers precise tumbling motions that are perfect for delicates. 
7.8 cu. ft. Mega Capacity: Say never again to never-ending piles of laundry—this mega capacity dryer is among the largest front load ventless heat pump unit in its class² and can easily handle the laundry needs of a family of five. How big is 7.8 cu. ft.? Big enough to fit a king-size comforter and more in a single load for big time savings every week., 
Sleek Ventless Design: Space-saving ventless design means it can be installed virtually anywhere. No detail was overlooked in this dryer's sleek, modern style. The flat front design with a choice of black steel, graphite steel or white finish and tinted, tempered glass door brings a premium point of view to your laundry space., 
LCD Digital Dial Control: Customize your dry—or let AI Dry do it for you. Laundry day is just that easy with LG’s built-in intelligence and intuitive LCD dial. Streamlined controls give you more of what you need with each turn of the dial, from descriptions of each setting and helpful prompts to status updates and remaining cycle time. Easily access more than 20 cycles and quickly modify any cycle using the touch panel for total laundry control., 
Dual Inverter Heat Pump Technology: Meet a more modern approach to drying. LG's DUAL Inverter Heat Pump technology uses up to 65% less energy to dry every load.³ Not only does this ENERGY STAR certified dryer feature LG’s most energy efficient ventless drying system, the low temperatures are easier on clothes and can help them look their best for longer. And with no need for venting, this dryer is easy to install and is virtually maintenance free., 
Inverter Direct Drive Motor System: When it comes to powerful, reliable performance, there’s just no comparison. Featuring LG Exclusive Direct Drive Dryer, this ventless dryer provides even drying performance and precise tumbling motions that are extra kind to delicates. You’ll enjoy quiet operation and greater energy efficiency than belt-driven motors—no belts, no pulleys, no worries. What else can you count on? The peace of mind of a 10-year limited warranty., 
Built-In Intelligence: AI Sensor Dry with Infrared Sensor: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. A combination of AI Sensor Dry plus an additional IR sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes., 
: All to ensure this ventless dryer delivers the LG drying performance you expect—no more damp clothes, no more over-drying., 
ThinQ Smart Technology: The ThinQ app offers control and convenience to help you simplify life and enjoy the comforts of home. Control your dryer remotely or use voice commands with Google or Alexa voice assistants. Plus, download additional cycles and access Smart Diagnosis, customer support, and more.⁴, 
ThinQ UP: ThinQ UP enabled smart appliances receive continual software updates for new downloadable features and enhancements sent wirelessly to the appliance. Choose which features you want and customize your appliance based on your lifestyle and personal preferences., 
ThinQ Care: Available within the ThinQ app, ThinQ Care sends proactive usage, maintenance, and diagnostic alerts to your smartphone to help keep your LG smart appliances running smoothly., 
Auto Cleaning Condenser: Unlike some dryers that require manual cleaning of the condenser for optimal performance, LG’s Auto Cleaning Condenser does the work for you. Using water extracted during the drying cycle, it powerfully flushes away lint and debris every time you dry for better airflow, better drying and enhanced energy efficiency—automatically., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer to save even more space., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
: Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer. It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home.,

LG,dle3600v,"Tired of toggling through endless cycles only to have clothes come out damp or overdry? This dryer takes out the guesswork, with built-in intelligence that uses advanced sensors and AI technology to automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more. It can even talk to your washer to select a compatible cycle—so you don’t have to. What could be easier? Use the ThinQ app to start or stop the dryer from anywhere, and even receive an alert when clothes are dry. Durable and stylish tempered glass door with white or silver accents adds the perfect finish. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Technology: No matter where you are, use the ThinQ app to start the dryer, extend cycle time to avoid wrinkles and receive an alert when clothes are dry. Go hands-free—select dryer features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents., 
FlowSense: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators let you know when your ducts and filter need cleaning to avoid lint buildup, improve the dryer’s performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and help give you safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer.: It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., ",39,27,30.12,7.4,$749.99,4.5,677,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-7-4-cu-ft-stackable-smart-electric-dryer-with-built-in-intelligence-graphite-steel/6419623.p?skuId=6419623,7.4 Cu.

LG,dlhc1455w,"This sleek dryer offers big style and big capacity in a small 24” wide footprint, with a go-anywhere ventless design that can be installed side by side or stacked on top of a compact LG washer. But saving space is just the beginning—LG’s innovative HeatPump technology saves energy with the dryer usage on every load. Unlike conventional condenser ventless dryers that extract the moisture from clothes and pumps it out of the dryer, this dryer extracts the moisture and recycles it for more energy-efficient drying, every day. 
4.2 cu. ft. Compact Capacity: This dryer handles surprisingly big loads for its size while expanding your installation options at the same time. The ventless design means you can put it anywhere, without worrying about long ducting runs, access to exterior walls or maintenance., 
Dual Inverter HeatPump Technology: Meet a more modern approach to drying. LG HeatPump technology extracts moisture from clothes and recycles the warm, humid air., 
Auto Cleaning Condenser: Using water extracted during the drying cycle, it powerfully flushes away lint and debris every time you dry for better airflow, better drying and enhanced energy efficiency—automatically., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
ThinQ Technology with Smart Pairing: Use the ThinQ app to start the laundry while you’re out shopping, check remaining cycle time or get notifications on your smartphone. Go hands-free—select features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
Sensor Dry: No more damp clothes—the built-in sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes. No more overdrying—dryer shuts off at just the right time to save energy with less wear and tear on clothes., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Chrome Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Chrome rims and matching control knobs complement the doors and enhance the premium feel., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer/dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door (Dryer): When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

LG,dlg7001w,"No one said laundry day was easy - but LG dryer innovations might just change your mind. It starts with the flexible LG EasyLoad door that opens two ways for easy loading and unloading. LG Sensor Dry system measures the amount of moisture levels throughout the cycle and automatically adjusts the drying time. All the more reason to take advantage of the 7.3 cu. ft. extra large capacity that handles really large loads. You’ll save time and energy. 
7.3 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day fit more clothes in every load with 7.3 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
Sensor Dry: No more damp clothes the built-in sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes. No more overdrying—dryer shuts off at just the right time to save energy with less wear and tear on clothes., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when your ducts and filter need lint buildup cleaning, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
SmartDiagnosis: If you ever experience an issue with your LG washer or dryer, you don't have to worry. The SmartDiagnosis feature helps the service center diagnose problems over the phone, or with a simple app on your smart phone, helping you minimize costly, inconvenient service calls.¹, 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
: Shipped with a 3-prong (grounding) plug. Gas dryers are configured for natural gas hook-up, but a gas connector must be purchased separately.,

Asko,t208hw,"24 Inch Electric Heat Pump Dryer with 4.1 cu. ft. Capacity, Butterfly Drying System, Soft Drum Technology, Delay Start, Anti-Crease Mode, LCD Display, End Program Signal, and Humidity Sensor 
Soft Drum: Soft Drum is a solution developed to enhance air flow around the load, thereby increasing the drying effect. The circular indentations with bevelled edges also have a cushioning effect that reduces wear and tear on fabrics. The new drum design allows for even and gentle drying with both small and large loads., 
Butterfly Drying: This smart feature is our own invention. It saves both the motor and your ironing board. The unique paddles inside the drum tumble the clothes in a figure eight to prevent the clothes from bundling. This leads to a reduced need to reverse the drum rotation. This is an intelligent function which saves the motor and the belt from any unnecessary strain and your clothes from creasing., 
Multi Filter System: The Multi Filter System effectively traps all lint before reaching more sensitive parts of the tumble dryer. This keeps the drying times shorter and the machine up and running., 
Sensi dry: The ASKO Sensi Dry system measures moisture in and around the machine, which prevents unnecessary over-drying as well as wear and tear on your clothes., 
Stainless Steel Drum: At ASKO, we believe not only that stainless steel will outlast for example, plastic, but also that quality materials will always look better in years to come. Eventually, galvanised steel rusts, so we decided to make our drums out of stainless steel.

Asko,t208cw,"24 Inch Electric Dryer with 4.1 Cu. Ft. Capacity, Butterfly Drying System, Soft Drum Technology, Line Concept, Multi Filter System, LCD Display, Stack Kit Included, 9 Dry Cycles, Sensi Dry, Airing, Anti-Crease, and Auto Synthetic 
Soft Drum: Soft Drum is a solution developed to enhance air flow around the load, thereby increasing the drying effect. The circular indentations with bevelled edges also have a cushioning effect that reduces wear and tear on fabrics. The new drum design allows for even and gentle drying with both small and large loads., 
Butterfly Drying: This smart feature is our own invention. It saves both the motor and your ironing board. The unique paddles inside the drum tumble the clothes in a figure eight to prevent the clothes from bundling. This leads to a reduced need to reverse the drum rotation. This is an intelligent function which saves the motor and the belt from any unnecessary strain and your clothes from creasing., 
Multi Filter System: The Multi Filter System effectively traps all lint before reaching more sensitive parts of the tumble dryer. This keeps the drying times shorter and the machine up and running., 
Sensi dry: The ASKO Sensi Dry system measures moisture in and around the machine, which prevents unnecessary over-drying as well as wear and tear on your clothes., 
Stainless Steel Drum: At ASKO, we believe not only that stainless steel will outlast for example, plastic, but also that quality materials will always look better in years to come. Eventually, galvanised steel rusts, so we decided to make our drums out of stainless steel.

Soft Drum: Soft Drum is a solution developed to enhance air flow around the load, thereby increasing the drying effect. The circular indentations with bevelled edges also have a cushioning effect that reduces wear and tear on fabrics. The new drum design allows for even and gentle drying with both small and large loads., 
Butterfly Drying: This smart feature is our own invention. It saves both the motor and your ironing board. The unique paddles inside the drum tumble the clothes in a figure eight to prevent the clothes from bundling. This leads to a reduced need to reverse the drum rotation. This is an intelligent function which saves the motor and the belt from any unnecessary strain and your clothes from creasing., 
Multi Filter System: The Multi Filter System effectively traps all lint before reaching more sensitive parts of the tumble dryer. This keeps the drying times shorter and the machine up and running., 
Sensi dry: The ASKO Sensi Dry system measures moisture in and around the machine, which prevents unnecessary over-drying as well as wear and tear on your clothes.,

LG,dlgx4201b,"No longer just a companion to your washer, LG dryers deliver a new level of convenience and clothing care. When there’s no time to wash, TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles in just 10 minutes. Built-in intelligence automatically selects the right settings to eliminate the guesswork, and can even talk to your washer to pick a compatible cycle. Smart features let you start the dryer when you’re on the go or send routine maintenance updates to keep your appliance in tip-top shape. All with a sleek design and scratch-resistant tempered glass door with chrome accent rim for lasting good looks. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
TurboSteam Technology: Go ahead, wear it again—in just 10 minutes, TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles and odors in up to 5 garments when you don’t have time to wash. Also refreshes children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
ThinQ Technology: No matter where you are, use the ThinQ app to start the dryer, extend cycle time to avoid wrinkles and receive an alert when clothes are dry. Go hands-free—select dryer features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

LG,dlg3601w,"Tired of toggling through endless cycles only to have clothes come out damp or overdry? This dryer takes out the guesswork, with built-in intelligence that uses advanced sensors and AI technology to automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more. It can even talk to your washer to select a compatible cycle—so you don’t have to. What could be easier? Use the ThinQ app to start or stop the dryer from anywhere, and even receive an alert when clothes are dry. Durable and stylish tempered glass door with white or silver accents adds the perfect finish. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Technology: No matter where you are, use the ThinQ app to start the dryer, extend cycle time to avoid wrinkles and receive an alert when clothes are dry. Go hands-free—select dryer features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents., 
FlowSense: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators let you know when your ducts and filter need cleaning to avoid lint buildup, improve the dryer’s performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and help give you safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use.,

Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents.,
